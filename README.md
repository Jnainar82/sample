# 📊 Healthcare Data Classification using Random Forest

## 🔍 Overview
This project implements a **Machine Learning classification model** using **Random Forest** to predict heart disease based on healthcare data. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation to ensure high accuracy.

## 🛠 Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Removes unnecessary columns and handles missing values.
- **Feature Encoding**: Converts categorical data into numerical form.
- **Model Training**: Uses **Random Forest Classifier** for prediction.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measures accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset is stored in `healthcare.csv` (raw) and processed into `output.csv`.
- It includes patient information such as age, BMI, hypertension, HbA1c level, and heart disease status.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Ensure you have Python (3.7+) installed.

## 📜 Usage
Run the script to preprocess data and train the model:
```bash
python final.py
```

### 🔹 Expected Output
- **Accuracy Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Report**

## 🏆 Results & Performance
- The Random Forest model achieves **high accuracy**.
- Key insights are derived from feature importance and model evaluation.
